  ## 1. Overview
  ![CAN bus (consisting of two wires, CAN low and CAN high)](./images/intro.png)  
  *CAN bus (consisting of two wires, CAN low and CAN high)*

  The CAN bus system enables each ECU to communicate with all other ECUs - without complex dedicated wiring.  
  The CAN High (CAN_H) and CAN Low (CAN_L) lines are twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) or noise.

  ![CAN in the 7-layer OSI model](./images/can_osi_layer.png)  
  *CAN in the 7-layer OSI model*

  The controller area network is described by a data link layer and physical layer (in the 7-layer OSI model).
  - Baud rate: CAN nodes must be connected via a two wire bus with baud rates up to 1 Mbit/s (Classical CAN) or 5 Mbit/s (CAN FD)
  - Cable length: Maximal CAN cable lengths should be between 500 meters (125 kbit/s) and 40 meters (1 Mbit/s)
  - Termination: The CAN bus must be properly terminated using a **120 Ohms CAN bus termination resistor** at each end of the bus  

  CAN in the context of automotive vehicle networks:  
  
  **High speed CAN bus (ISO 11898)**:
>   + The most popular CAN standard for the physical layer
>   + Support bit rates from 40 kbit/s to 1 Mbit/s (Classical CAN)
>   + Provides simple cabling and practically used in all automotive applications today
>   + The basis for several higher layer protocols such as OBD2, J1939, NMEA 2000, CANopen etc.
>   + The second generation of CAN is referred to as CAN FD (CAN with Flexible Data-rate)

  **Low speed CAN bus**:
>   + This standard enables bit rates from 40 kbit/s to 125 kbit/s
>   + Allows the CAN bus commmunication to continue even if there is a fault on one of the two wires
>   + It is also referred to as 'fault tolerant CAN'
>   + In this system, each CAN node has it's own [CAN termination](./images/can_termination.png)  

  **LIN bus**:
>   + A lower cost supplement to CAN bus networks, with less harness and cheaper nodes
>   + LIN bus clusters typically consist of a LIN master acting as gateway and up to 16 slave nodes
>   + Typical use cases: For non-critical vehicle functions like aircondition, door functionality etc.  

  **Automotive ethernet**:
>   + Support the high bandwidth requirements of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), infotainment systems, cameras etc.  
>   + Offer much higher data transfer rates vs. CAN bus, but lacks some of the safety/performance features of Classical CAN and CAN FD  

  CAN FD offers three benefits (vs Classical CAN):
  - It enables data rates up to 8 Mbit/s (vs 1 Mbit/s)
  - It allows data payloads of up to 64 bytes (vs 8 bytes)
  - It enables improved security via authentication  

  ## 2. Can frames
  Communication over the CAN bus is done via CAN frames.
  ### 2.1. Standard CAN frame
  The Standard CAN frame with 11 bits identifier (CAN 2.0A) is the type used in most cars.  
  The extended 29-bit identifier frame (CAN 2.0B) is identical except the longer ID (11-bit Base ID + 18-bit ID Extension).  

  ![Standard CAN frame](./images/std_can_frame.png)  
  *Standard CAN frame*

  - **SOF**: The Start of Frame is a 'dominant 0' to tell the other nodes that a CAN node intends to talk
  - **ID**: The ID is the frame identifier - lower values have higher priority
  - **RTR**: The Remote Transmission Request indicates whether a node sends data or requests dedicated data from another node
  - **Control**: The Control contains the Identifier Extension Bit (IDE) which is a 'dominant 0' for 11-bit. It also 
  contains the 4 bit Data Length Code (DLC) that specifies the length of the data bytes to be transmitted (0 to 8 bytes)
  - **Data**: The Data contains the data bytes aka payload, which includes CAN signals that can be extracted and decoded for information
  - **CRC**: The Cyclic Redundancy Check is used to ensure data integrity
  - **ACK**: The ACK slot indicates if the node has acknowledged and received the data correctly
  - **EOF**: The EOF marks the end of the CAN frame  

  ### 2.2. Remote frame  

  ![Remote frame](./images/can_remote_frame.png)  
  *Remote frame*  
  - A node wants a particular Data frame, so it sends the Remote frame with same Message ID on the Bus  
  - Nowadays Remote frame is obsolete and not used in CAN protocol

  ### 2.3. Error frame  

  ![Error frame](./images/can_error_frame.png)  
  *Error frame*  

  - If a node detects an error in the data frame being transmitted on the bus currently, then it destroys that data frame and signals all other nodes by transmitting a error frame
  - The error can be detected by any of the receiver nodes or the transmitter node  

  ### 2.4. Overload frame  
  - Overload frame is transmitted by a node when it is overloaded and needs some time to process the data frame received previously
  - Overload frame format is same as Error frame
  - The oveloaded node keeps the bus busy with its overload frame to prevent other nodes to start transmitting data frames
  - Maximum of 3 consecutive overload frames can be transmitted by each node after a data frame  

  ## 3. Bus Arbitration  
  If two nodes try to put different bits on the bus simultaneously, the bus will take the dominant bit value and ignore the Recessive bit  
  ![Arbitration Field and Control Field](./images/can_arbitration_and_control_fields.png)  
  *Arbitration Field and Control Field*  
  - Bit wise arbitration across the Arbitration Field  
  - Dominant Bus Level = 0, Recessive Bus Level = 1  

  ![An example of CAN Bus arbitration](./images/can_ex_bus_arbitration.jpg)  
  *An example of CAN Bus arbitration*  
  - CAN bus is considered idle after the transmission of a message followed by the Intermission Field
  - Intermission Field: After the ACK field, there is a time period known as the Intermission Field 
  (This is typically 3.5 bit times long and serves as a mandatory gap between two messages)  
  - Node that transmits message with lowest ID (highest priority) wins arbitration, continues to transmit. Competing nodes switch to receiving mode
  - Nodes that lost arbitration will start new arbitration as soon as bus is free for access again => No message gets lost
