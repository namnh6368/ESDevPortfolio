  ## 1. AUTOSAR architecture
  
  ![AUTOSAR architecture](./images/autosar_architecture.png)  
  *AUTOSAR architecture*

  AUTOSAR is an AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture used to develop the software architecture for an ECU.
  It consists of 3 layers:
  - **Application layer**: Contain the application software called Software Components (SWC).
  - **RTE (Run-Time Environment) layer**: Provide an interface and enables communication between the Basic Software (BSW) and the application layer.  
  RTE separates the application layer from the BSW and enables the Inter ECU and Intra ECU communication.  
  RTE works on Virtual Bus Communication (VFB) that provides the mechanism to connect all these components (SWC, BSW) and enables communication.
  - **Basic software layer**: Provide a hardware-independent abstraction to the upper layer.  
  BSW has 3 layers:  
    - **- System Service Layer**: Provide communication services, memory services, ECU mode management, state management, and diagnostic services.  
    It also contains an Operating System (OS) for task scheduling and prioritization.
    - **- ECU Abstraction Layer**: It interfaces and abstracts the drivers of MCAL and makes the higher software layer independent of the ECU hardware.  
    It also contains the drivers for external devices.
    - **- Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL)**: It interfaces and abstracts the hardware of the ECU.  
    MCAL provides standardized interfaces to the microcontroller peripherals and devices, ensuring that the upper layers of the software stack can operate independently of the specific microcontroller hardware.  
    It includes drivers for various microcontroller components such as ADC, PWM, I/O ports, communication interfaces (CAN, LIN, SPI, etc.), and watchdog timers.

  ## 2. COM stack

  <br>
  <em>AUTOSAR COM stack</em>

  - AUTOSAR provides communication services through ComStack. It is a part of the BSW layer.
  - In AUTOSAR, information/data is transmitted and received in terms of signals and PDUs (Protocol Data Units)  
  Signals in AUTOSAR are used at the application layer, where the Software Components (SWC) exchange information/data with the RTE in terms of signals. For examples:  
    - **- Engine Speed**: The current speed of the engine in RPM.
    - **- Vehicle Speed**: The speed at which the vehicle is traveling.
    - **- Fuel Level**: The amount of fuel remaining in the tank.
    - **- Throttle Position**: The position of the throttle pedal.
    - **- Brake Pressure**: The pressure applied to the brake system.
    - **- Steering Angle**: The angle of the steering wheel.
    - **- Battery Voltage**: The voltage level of the vehicle's battery.
    - **- Ambient Temperature**: The temperature outside the vehicle.  
  These signals are then mapped to specific PDUs in the service layer, which ensures that the data is correctly formatted and transmitted to the appropriate lower layers.  
  PDUs (Protocol Data Units) encapsulate signals and include additional information such as source and destination addresses, protocol-specific control information, and error-checking codes.  
  They are used throughout the communication stack to ensure that signals are transmitted reliably and can be correctly interpreted by another ECU or a specific software component within the same ECU.
  - Each layer has its PDU.  
  For example, while transmitting from the service layer to the ECU abstraction layer, the service layer adds PCI (Protocol Control Information) into the PDU
  that helps the abstraction layer to understand it and its contents.

  ### 2.1. Service layer
  Service layer provides communication and management services that include the following modules:
  - AUTOSAR COM
  - PDU Router (PDUR)
  - BUSTP
  - BUSSM
  - BUSNM
  - Generic NM
  - IpduM

  ### 2.2. ECU abstraction layer
  This layer contains the driver for an external device and transceivers such as an external CAN controller, external ADC, CAN transceiver driver, and FlexRay transceiver driver.
  - BUS Interface (CANIF, LINIF, FRIF, ETHIF, etc.)
  - Transceiver Driver (CANTRCV, LINTRCV, FRTRCV, ETHTRCV, etc.)
  - External Device Driver (CAN, LIN, FR, ETH, etc.)

  ### 2.3. MCAL
  This layer contains communication drivers that are protocol/BUS-specific and directly accesses the hardware to offer the hardware-independent API to an upper layer.
  - CAN Driver
  - LIN Driver
  - FlexRay Driver
  - Ethernet Driver

  ## 3. CAN stack
  <img src="./images/autosar_canstack.png" alt="AUTOSAR CAN stack" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
  <br>
  <em>AUTOSAR CAN stack</em>

  - The CAN stack is a part of the COM stack that provides communication services over the CAN bus.
  - The CAN stack consists of the following layers:
    - **- CAN Transport Layer (CAN TP)**: It provides the services for segmented transmission and reception of large data packets over the CAN bus.
    - **- CAN Network Management Layer (CAN NM)**: It provides the services for network management, including bus-off recovery, node guarding, and network availability management.
    - **- CAN Interface Layer (CAN IF)**: It provides the services for the initialization and configuration of the CAN controller hardware.
    - **- CAN Driver Layer (CAN Driver)**: It provides the services for the low-level interaction with the CAN controller hardware, including message transmission and reception.

  The following modules are required for the BSW configuration of the CAN Communication stack:
  - ECUC (ECU Configuration)
  - AUTOSAR COM
  - PDU Router (PDUR)
  - CAN Interface (CANIF)
  - CAN Driver
  - Port Driver

  ### 3.1. ECUC
  It defines the number of PDUs used in the ECU for commnication and it contains the PDU name, data type, and length (DLC).  
  For example a few basic configuration parameters are:
  - PDU length: mentioned in bytes.
  - Data type: mentioned as UINT8, UINT16, FLOAT32, etc.

  ### 3.2. AUTOSAR COM
  - COM module defines four different types of an object for the communication system: I-PDUs, I-PDU Groups, Signals, and Signal Groups.
  - I-PDU is an interaction layer protocol data unit that contains the signals that have been received from an upper layer or a lower layer. 
  The collection of multiple I-PDUs that follow the same direction (either received or transmitted) is called the I-PDU groups.
  - Signal is a data element that is transmitted from one ECU to another ECU.
  - Signal groups are used to define the complex data types in AUTOSAR that contains one or more data elements.  
  The basic configuration required:

  <br>
  <em>COM configuration</em>

  ### 3.3. PDU Router (PDUR)
  The PDUR module is responsible for routing I-PDUs within the CAN communication stack. This involves configuring a routing table that specifies the source and destination of each I-PDU.  
  The basic configuration required:  
  <img src="./images/autosar_comstack_PDUR_configuration.png" alt="PDUR configuration" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
  <br>
  <em>PDUR configuration</em>

  ### 3.4. CAN Transport Protocol (CANTP)
  CANTP is used to segment and reassemble the CAN I-PDUs that are longer than 8-bytes for the standard CAN and 64 bytes for CAN FD.  
  It also handles TP frames i.e., Single Frame (SF), First Frame (FF), Flow Control (FC), and Consecutive Frame (CF). 
  It receives the I-PDUs from the PDUR and links those I-PDUs to the N-PDUs. It later sends the N-PDUs to the CAN Interface.  

  ### 3.5. CAN Interface (CANIF)
  CAN Interface receives information from the service layer (PDUR/ CAN TP) during the transmission and receives L-PDUs from MCAL (CAN driver) during the reception.  
  At CANIF, it maps the incoming PDUs from PDUR/CANTP to Hardware Object Handle (HOH) and vice versa.  
  It has two different hardware object handles for transmission and reception (HRH & HTH) that are mapped to an associated PDU.  
  It receives the I-PDUs from PDUR or the N-PDUs from CANTP, prepares the L-PDUs, and sends them to the CAN driver.  
  The basic configuration required:

  <br>
  <em>CANIF configurations</em>

  ### 3.6. CAN State Manager (CANSM)
  CANSM is used to identify the network in the ECU. An ECU may have multiple networks and each network has a unique network handle.  
  Each network works in different modes of communication and those modes are requested by the ComM module through CANSM (in case of CAN).  
  It helps to change the mode of communication depending on the request. It also defines the time duration for the BUS off control.  
  The basic configuration required:  
  <img src="./images/autosar_canstack_cansm.png" alt="CANSM configurations" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
  <br>
  <em>CANSM configurations</em>

  ### 3.7. CAN Driver
  CAN driver is responsible for initiating transmissions and notifying events when any data is received or given acknowledgment in feedback for data transmission.  
  Multiple CAN controllers can be controlled by one CAN module if they belong to the same CAN hardware unit.  
  (*CAN Hardware unit may have more than one CAN controller of the same type and it has one CAN driver).  
  The basic configuration required:

  <br>
  <em>CAN driver configurations</em>

  ### 3.8. Port Driver
  It is responsible for the initialization of the port structure of the microcontroller.  
  It defines the direction and functionality of the port pin.  
  The configuration needed for CAN controller pins is: Microcontroller dependent for channel and alternate function selection:  
  - CAN_RX (Receive pin)
  - CAN_TX (Transmit pin)
